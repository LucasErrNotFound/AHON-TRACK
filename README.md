# AHON Track :star2:
AHON Track is an **Avalonia-based Desktop Gym Management System** that handles **employee management**, **membership management**, **scheduling**, **billing**, **inventory**, **analytics**, and **backup**. It aims to replace traditional pen-and-paper tracking with a **modern, digitized solution**—designed to simplify operations and empower gyms with efficient management tools.

## Features :jigsaw:
### :closed_lock_with_key: Login Window
A custom-styled authentication interface for staff and admin, featuring username and password login with clear **data validation** and **toast messages**. It supports **role-based access**, ensuring each user receives the correct permissions upon sign-in. With the newly added **Forgot Password** feature, users can now recover their accounts directly from the login screen, improving accessibility and reducing administrative load. (outdated gif)

### :computer: Shell Window
The Shell Window serves as the central workspace of the gym management system, offering unified access to modules such as employee management, walk-ins, member records, scheduling, billing, and analytics. It automatically adapts to the user’s role, giving admins full access while presenting staff with only the modules relevant to their permissions for a secure and focused workflow.
